2. Create an ARP request directed to broadcast MACs requesting IP addresses.
3. Send packets and get response.
4. Analyze the response.
5. Verify the correspondence of the first 3 octets of the Mac Address that identify the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) and extract information about the Vendor
